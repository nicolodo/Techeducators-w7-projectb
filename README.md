Requirements
🎯 Create a client using React. 
    ✅ I have created a vite react project in the client folder of the monorepo
🎯 Use Express to create your server, using both GET and POST endpoints.
    npm install express cors dotenv pg
        express: server
        cors: middleware like cloudflare?
        dotenv: lets me use local environment vars
        pg: lets me interact with a database like supabase

    I've made the server I will now make a client page which connects to it.
🎯 Build a React form for users to create posts.
🎯 Create multiple pages using React Router.
🎯 Design a database schema, and seed the database with some realistic data.
    I have made a db connection and have tested CRUD which works.
🎯 Use SQL to retrieve posts from the database in your Express server.
🎯 Display all posts using .map().
🎯 Use an interval and useEffect() to poll your database.
